    <h3>Work Experience</h3>

    <span class="company">Indigov</span>
    <span class="years">(2023 - Present)</span><br />
    <span class="title">Senior SDET</span>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Built Indigov's end-to-end Playwright test harness up from a handful of
        automated test cases to more than 300.
      </li>
      <li>
        Doubled Indigov's K6 load and performance test coverage. Regularly
        reported all findings identified with the help of DataDog application
        performance and real user monitoring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewrote Indigov's K6 test harness in TypeScript. Implemented a custom
        bundling solution using Bun in support of doing so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented GitHub Actions workflows for executing load and performance
        K6 tests against feature branches, on <code>cron</code> schedules, and
        ad hoc via GitHub Actions' graphical and command-line interfaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updated Indigov's Playwright harness to execute tests in parallel across
        multiple GitHub Actions runners to reduce execution times from
        approximately one hour to less than 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mentored Indigov's manual QA Engineer on a twice-weekly basis, coaching
        them through the process of implementing new and updated automated test
        coverage using Playwright and Jest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented feature flagging of all outbound email traffic,
        conditionally routing emails to SparkPost's sink server to avoid leaking
        test data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated Indigov's K6 load and performance test harness with Auth0's
        and Okta's client credentials authentication flows. Leveraged said flows
        to simulate SparkPost inbound email webhooks and test their ingestion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Migrated Indigov's Playwright and K6 test harnesses from Auth0 to Okta
        authentication.

      <li>
        Configured coverage collection and enforcement for all executions of
        Indigov's unit and database integration Jest test harness in CI.
      </li>

    <span class="company">Trove</span> <span class="years">(2022 - 2023)</span
    ><br />
    <span class="title">Staff Software Engineer II</span>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented Trove's Continuous Delivery process. Trained
        Software, QA, and Release Engineers on the new process and worked with
        Engineering leadership to incrementally migrate codebases to the
        Continuous Delivery release model. Adoption of this process resulted in
        a ~30% improvement in Trove Engineering's median cycle time and 12-fold
        increase in the number of weekly software deployments.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented Continuous Delivery pipelines for all Trove codebases.
      </li>

      <li>
        Parallelized deployments to AWS EC2 and ECS environments, improving
        CI/CD pipeline execution times by up to 37.5%.
      </li>

      <li>
        Reworked Trove's Docker image build process to produce immutable
        artifacts to be used when deploying to all remote environments. Improved
        CI/CD pipeline execution times by 37.5-43% as a result.
      </li>

      <li>
        Optimized Trove's Docker images, reducing their average size by ~41% and
        improving build pipelines' runtimes by 10-17%.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented a custom Docker image to be used by all CI pipelines to
        execute common tasks like building Docker images, pushing images to AWS
        ECR, deploying builds to AWS ECS, and notifying Slack.
      </li>

      <li>
        Designed and implemented a reusable Terraform module which enabled
        Engineers to define a new AWS Batch job definition in fewer than 30
        lines of Terragrunt code.
      </li>

      <li>
        Designed and implemented job execution pipelines to run on both EC2 and
        ECS Fargate AWS infrastructure using SSM and Batch, respectively.
      </li>

      <li>
        Added support for integrating AWS ECS services with New Relic APM using
        a single line of code with Terraform and Terragrunt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented AWS SQS queues and supporting IAM policy changes and
        CloudWatch alarms in Terraform.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented pre-push hooks and CI pipelines enforcing linting and
        versioning best practices for multiple Trove codebases.
      </li>

      <li>
        Defined KPIs for Trove's Engineering organization, specifying metrics to
        gather, reporting tools to use, and goals to target.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented test coverage enforcement and metrics collection for all
        Trove codebases. Published test coverage reports to AWS S3 for each
        codebase following every test execution in CI. Generated aggregated test
        coverage CSV and HTML reports and regularly presented on Engineering's
        progress to leadership.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented custom tooling which integrated with the Google Calendar API
        to measure and visualize how much time Engineering team members spent in
        meetings on a weekly basis.
      </li>

        allowing for the addition of an arbitrary number of API, UI, and unit
        test harnesses. Extracted reusable components into a shared utility
        subpackage and implemented monorepo-wide static analysis and package
        management tooling.
      </li>

      <li>
        Designed and implemented generic test automation suites which could be
        easily configured to test any of Trove's partner storefront and in-store
        trade-in web applications.
      </li>

        across all of Trove codebases over the course of a year.
      </li>

      <li>
        Specified and led the Test Automation team's effort to migrate from
        JavaScript to TypeScript. Drafted documentation and implemented

        without pausing any other workstreams.
      </li>

      <li>
        Reworked the Test Automation team's technical interviewing process,
        providing candidates with a takehome coding challenge starting point
        which more accurately mirrored the daily work of Test Automation team
        members.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented load and performance test coverage and related CI pipelines
        using Artillery and Bitbucket Pipelines.
      </li>

      <li>
        Implemented visual diff test automation harnesses using Cypress and
        Percy.
