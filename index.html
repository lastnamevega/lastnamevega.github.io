            and negative test cases across 11 microservices.
        <li>Facilitated weekly workshops covering various software development concepts and practices, including
            continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), unit testing, shell scripting, and multiplatform development.
        <li>Provided the QA team with technical leadership, reviewing all pull requests submitted by other members of

            applications as a git subtree, replete with bespoke tooling.
        <li>Implemented scripts in Bash enabling all Cypress test automation suites to execute with an arbitrary level
            of parallelization, both locally and in GitLab CI/CD.
        <li>Rewrote all Cypress jobs run in GitLab CI/CD to run in parallel and cache dependencies to optimize
            execution time and retryability.
